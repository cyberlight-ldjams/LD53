Having mastered the art of levitating objects, you have been accepted to an apprenticeship program under Merlin himself! 



Welcome, young wizard. I am Merlin the Great! I'm impressed with your mastery of the levitation spell and am proud to welcome you to my apprenticeship program! You will learn much from me if you put in enough work--in my warehouse!
...What? I don't get many students these days, so I have a side business. For those learned in magical arts, this is their one-stop-shop for all sorts of mystical curios!
Check the daily orders with the Tab kay and find the items in the warehouse. Press E or Space to levitate the items and bring them to the boxing station. Once boxed, load completed orders into the wagon.
Once you've earned 500A, we can being the rest of your training... What? Just because you're my apprentice doesn't make these magic lessons free.
...Scam? What scam? You just have to work for me so that you can pay me to teach you magic, then once you know enough magic, you can pay me again to buy magic things... Yes, this is a legitimate apprenticeship.
No more questions! Get to work!







Merlin's business model:
Offer an "apprenticeship"
Apprentice works in warehouse
Merlin keeps earnings as a fee for magic lessons
Once apprentice knows enough magic, he buys things from warehouse to use said magic
